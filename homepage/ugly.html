                    <p>
                        In my previous internship, I worked for TRIUMF, which is Canadaâ€™s 
                        particle accelerator center. I kept working for TRIUMF, and meanwhile, 
                        I worked for IBM and Red Hat Inc. on an open-source project named Adoptium 
                        which is managed and run by Eclipse Foundation. As developer for the Adoptium 
                        project, I mainly use Java to develop Jenkins server. My experience confirmed 
                        my intention to develop my research skills and goal.
